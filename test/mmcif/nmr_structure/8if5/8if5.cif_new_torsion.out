The backbone torsional angle for nucleic acid 

 
Note: alpha:   O3'(i-1)-P-O5'-C5'
      beta:    P-O5'-C5'-C4'
      gamma:   O5'-C5'-C4'-C3'
      delta:   C5'-C4'-C3'-O3'
      epsilon: C4'-C3'-O3'-P(i+1)
      zeta:    C3'-O3'-P(i+1)-O5'(i+1)

      chi for pyrimidines(Y): O4'-C1'-N1-C2
          chi for purines(R): O4'-C1'-N9-C4

    (The number -9999.99 means that the angle can not be calculated)
